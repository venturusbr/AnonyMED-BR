## ðŸš€ Overview

Medical record anonymization is essential to protect patient privacy while enabling research and the development of AI solutions in healthcare.  
This project introduces **AnonyMED-BR**, a dataset for anonymization of medical records in **Brazilian Portuguese**, and evaluates different anonymization strategies based on **transformer models**.

We compare two complementary approaches:
- **Extractive anonymization**: identifying sensitive entities using NER-based models.  
- **Generative anonymization**: rewriting medical records with sensitive information replaced by tags.  

We also propose a novel **LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation framework**, using a reasoning LLM to assess anonymization quality, information loss, and re-identification risk.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset: AnonyMED-BR

- **2,962 medical records**:  
  - 1,075 real (from a Brazilian tertiary hospital)  
  - 1,887 synthetic (generated and validated using GPT-4o)  

- **Entities covered**: patient names, doctors, IDs, dates, hospitals, addresses, contact information, and other identifiers.  
- Annotation reached **95% inter-annotator agreement**.  
- The data complies with **LGPD (Brazil)** and **GDPR (EU)**.

## ðŸ§  Models Evaluated

We benchmarked **extractive** and **generative** strategies across several models:

- **BERT-based**:  
  - BERTimbau-leNER 
  - mBERT  
  - BioBERTpt  

- **T5-based**:  
  - ptt5-v2   

- **GPT-based**:  
  - GPT-4o 
  - GPT-4o mini

## ðŸ”‘ Key Findings

- **BERTimbau-leNER** achieved the best **overall performance** (F1 = 0.9270), particularly strong on synthetic data.  
- **GPT-4o** was the **best on real data** (F1 = 0.9356), highlighting its robustness to noisy and complex records.  
- **Synthetic data works**:  
  - mBERT trained only on synthetic records (**mBERT-syn**) outperformed mBERT trained only on real data.  
  - mBERT-syn (F1 = 0.9257 overall) nearly matched the top-performing models, showing synthetic data as a **viable alternative** when real data is scarce.  
- **Task-specific fine-tuning > domain pretraining**:  
  - NER fine-tuning (BERTimbau-leNER) gave better results than domain pretraining (BioBERTpt).  
- **LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation** using Gemini 2.5 Pro provided deeper insights into anonymization quality:  
  - GPT-4o scored highest in **information preservation** and **low re-identification risk**.  
  - Extractive models like BERTimbau-leNER offered strong local deployment options with good privacy guarantees.
